# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description

For this task students had to create a Node.Js command line prompt application that generates and saves a logo in a SVG file. 

This task was fairly difficult, apart from inquerer I also used Jest to test shapes file in JS. Through the help of forums, chatGPT, and Learning assistants I was able to code a competent application in Node.Js. I am excited to develop my knowledge in Node.Js and other back-end frameworks.
